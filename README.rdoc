== Welcome to Gratifiled

Gratifiled is a filesharing app that harkens back to the good old days before Dropbox or Google docs.  The production site is available at http://gratifiled.herokuapp.com.

All tests are in rspec/Capybara.

To run locally, simply bundle install, migrate the databases, start a redis-server (command: redis-server), start sidekiq (command: sidekiq), and you're good to go!
